Hi there! I'm Ali, a web development engineer from ƒ∞stanbul aka the city of cats (suprising enough I also have 2 cats üê±üê±).

I'm a big fan of the JavaScript community and I follow the emerging ecosystem as much as I can. I enjoy finding out and reading about new technologies and materials even if I may never end up using them. I adore how many different tools people are building to solve challenging common problems.

I love React and Vue.js. I use Vue solutions on my day to day job and React ones on my personal projects. Though, this may change with the upcoming Vue 3 which I'm super excited about. After that, React Native might be the only place I use React extensively. Well... time will tell :)

Nowadays I play around with Nest.js for my backend needs and I try to keep up with Angular so that I'm knowledgeable enough to be dangerous using it. Yep... a lot of NG stuff lately, since Nest is like Angular for the backend. But after that, I'm going to spare some of my time to check Svelte, not because it's the hottest cake in the market, but because I like the idea of a more accessible web with super slim JavaScript bundles. I'd love this to be the main goal for people who build around the web and Svelte gives me hope for that direction.

Anyways, that's all from my tech side of the story.
If any of the things I mentioned above take your attention, DM me @alisabrigok on Twitter and let's talk some :)

Thanks for reading and checking my GitHub page.

Stay healthy.
